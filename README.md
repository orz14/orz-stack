## About ORZ Stack

ORZ Stack is the skeleton application for the Laravel starter kit project. It comes equipped with a system authentication that includes both basic authentication and socialite authentication. Additionally, ORZ Stack includes several built-in packages that I frequently use, such as Tailwind CSS, Livewire, Eloquent Sluggable, and many more. It offers a feature-rich boilerplate to kickstart your project and expedite your development process. Now, you're ready to create your awesome project.

## System Requirements

-   PHP >= 8.1
-   Composer
-   NodeJS & NPM/PNPM
-   MySQL

## Installation

-   Create a new ORZ Stack project via Composer's create-project command:

```bash
composer create-project orz14/orz-stack app-name
```

-   Once the project has been created, migrate the database:

```bash
cd app-name
php artisan migrate
```

-   Finally, start Laravel's local development server using Laravel Artisan's serve command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

-   Open the browser and go to http://localhost:8000 or http://app-name.test
